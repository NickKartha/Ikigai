# Ikigai
Get clear on your purpose and reason for being.

"People can feel real *ikigai* only when, on the basis of personal maturity, the satisfaction of various desires, love and happiness, encounters with others, and a sense of the value of life, they proceed toward self-realization." - Kobayashi Tsukasa

Ikigai (生き甲斐), pronounced “ee-kee-gah-ee”, is a Japanese concept that means “reason for being”, “reason for waking up in the morning”, “joie de vivre (joy of living)”.
